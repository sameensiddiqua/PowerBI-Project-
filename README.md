# PowerBI-Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard
In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data to uncover business insights. Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards with KPIs to track performance metrics. I leveraged DAX to calculate custom measures and built visuals to highlight daily and monthly sales trends. Additionally, I identified the best- and worst-selling pizzas, providing actionable insights to optimize sales strategies.
